    <h2>Why did the hamburger go to the gym? To get better buns!</h2>
    <p>
      Beef Burgers are easy and pleasing.
      <strong>Eat them. </strong><em>Now.</em>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>For the Burger</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>4 sesame-topped burger buns</li>
      <li>300g steak mince</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
      <li>small wedge of iceberg lettuce, finely shredded</li>
      <li>2 slices of mild cheddar or burger cheese</li>
      <li>1 gherkin sliced lengthways</li>
      <li>oven fries, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>For the <em>Secret</em> sauce</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>100g mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 tbsp American mustard</li>
      <li>large pinch garlic granules</li>
      <li>large pinch onion granules</li>
      <li>¼ tsp smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tsp pickle relish or finely chopped gherkin</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method of Cooking</h2>
    <ol style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px">
      <li>
        Tip the onions into a small bowl and pour over boiling water from the
        kettle until just covered. Leave to cool. Put all the sauce ingredients
        in another small bowl, then add 1 tbsp of the cooled onion water and mix
        until everything is evenly combined. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Halve two of the burger buns, then cut a thick slice from the middles of
        the other two buns. Toast or grill the middle slices on both sides and
        the other buns only on the cut sides, then set aside. Heat the oven to
        100C/80C fan/gas 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the mince into four loose piles and season. Heat ¼ tbsp of the
        oil in a heavy frying pan or skillet over a high heat and put one of the
        piles of beef in the pan. Working quickly, cover with a square of baking
        parchment and carefully use a second pan to press the beef patties down
        – be careful of the heat and rising steam as you do this. Keep the
        patties pressed down for about 10 seconds, then remove the weight and
        the paper, and leave the burger to cook for 2 mins more. Turn the
        patties and press down using a spatula, cooking for another 1 min.
        Transfer to a tray and keep warm in the oven while you cook the other
        burgers in the same way.
      </li>
      <li>
        When all the patties are cooked, it’s time to assemble the burgers.
        Spread some sauce over the bun bases, scatter with onions, then add
        lettuce, followed by a cheese slice, then a patty, a few gherkin slices
        and a middle slice of toasted bun. Spread over more sauce, then add more
        onions, lettuce, another patty and the bun tops. Serve with the oven
        fries and extra sauce on the side, if you like.
      </li>
    </ol>
