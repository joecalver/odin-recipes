      Beef Wellington makes an impressive centrepiece for a special dinner.

    <h2>Method of making this belter</h2>
    <ol style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px">
      <li>
        For the mushroom duxelle, heat the butter and vegetable oil in a frying
        pan. Once hot, add the chopped shallots and fry, stirring all the time,
        for two minutes. Tip in the chopped mushrooms. Reduce the heat a little
        and continue stirring and cooking for about ten minutes until the
        mushrooms are softened and their liquid has evaporated. Stir in the
        cream and cook for a further two minutes, then remove from the heat and
        leave to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the Wellington, heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat.
        Season the fillet all over with salt and pepper. Once the oil is
        smoking, add the beef and fry on all sides until it is a lovely
        caramel-brown colour. Remove to a plate and leave to cool. (NB. Don’t
        wash up the pan. Use this to make the Madeira and port reduction later.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the crêpes onto the work surface, one layer thick, but overlapping
        - you need to create an area about twice the thickness of the fillet,
        and about 2.5cm/1in longer at each end. Spread the mushroom duxelle over
        the crêpes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly pat the fillet with kitchen paper to remove any excess moisture,
        before placing the meat on top of the duxelle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully roll the side closest to you over the meat encasing it within
        the crêpes and mushrooms. The crêpes should cover the meat on all sides,
        but trim off any excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the wrapped fillet onto a sheet of clingfilm and wrap up tightly
        into a cylinder. Set aside in the fridge until completely cold, about
        half an hour
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile for the potato dauphinoise, preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas
        2.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rub the inside of a deep baking dish or casserole with the raw garlic.
        Place the sliced potatoes in a bowl and pour over the cream and season
        with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir to coat the potatoes,
        then lay them evenly in the garlicky baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the dish with foil and bake in the oven for 30 minutes. Remove the
        foil and cook for a further 20-30 minutes while you prepare the
        Wellington.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the pastry out on a well-floured surface to a rectangle with a
        thickness of about 3mm. Brush the pastry with beaten egg yolk. Remove
        the clingfilm from the beef fillet and place onto the middle of the
        pastry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap the pastry up over the beef fillet. Lightly stretch one edge of the
        seam so that it is not too thick, then press down firmly to seal.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should be left with a tube that is open at either end. Lightly press
        the ends of the pastry together using a rolling pin to seal and thin the
        two pieces. Then with a small knife, trim the edges on each side to form
        a triangle shape. Brush the triangle of pastry with a little egg and
        press it up against the side of the Wellington. Repeat with the other
        side before flipping over so that the Wellington is seam-side down.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place your Wellington onto a baking tray, brush with the remaining egg
        yolk set aside in the fridge to chill for 5-10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the oven temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4 (the dauphinoise should
        remain in the oven).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the Wellington from the fridge and score a pattern of your choice
        onto the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place in the oven with the potatoes dauphinoise and bake for 25 minutes.
        Remove the Wellington from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes.
        This should give you a perfectly pink finish to your meat. If you prefer
        it more cooked, then leave in the oven for longer, but you must ensure
        the meat is well rested.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the Madeira and port reduction, heat the butter in the same pan in
        which you cooked the beef fillet over a medium heat. Once bubbling, add
        the shallot and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the heat and add the port and Madeira. Simmer until the volume
        of liquid has reduced by half and then add the stock. Reduce again by
        half. When the sauce has a thick, syrupy consistency, strain through a
        fine sieve. Stir in the truffle peelings and keep warm until ready to
        serve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve slices of the beef Wellington with the potato dauphinoise
        alongside and the Madeira and port reduction.
