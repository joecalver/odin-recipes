    <h2>How to make a Lovely Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems. Don't be intimidated
      by all the layers of delicious Italian flavor — try this homemade lasagna
      recipe today!
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground
        meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with
        the ground meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and
        a can of crushed tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of
        parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity
        from the tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This homemade lasagna is
        seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Noodles:</strong> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This
        recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready
        variety to save time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheese:</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese
        and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus,
        they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now that you have bought these <em>incredible</em> ingredients, this is how
      you make the grub.

        <strong>Cook the meat:</strong> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until
        browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's

        <strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly
        salted water until they're al dente.

        cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Layer the ingredients according
        to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the
        lasagna is assembled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong> Cover with foil and bake in the
        preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue
        baking until the top is golden brown.
